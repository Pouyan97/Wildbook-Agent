      "['2442013224745', '', '', '', 'On Friday 19th April I took a day cruise around the Keppel Islands out of Rosslyn Bay Harbour  The boat was a sail catamaran operated by Funtastic cruises not sure of the actual boat name but I am sure you could work it out from that  About 30  45 minutes out of Rosslyn bay I saw a small shark cruising at the surface  I had a close lt5 metres away initially but brief look it was swimming in opposite direction to the boat It was probably 7080 cm long  certainly less than a metre had a very distinctive deep languid tail stroke that bent about half of the body was a bluecharcoal colour more blue than grey with obvious light bluewhite markings along most of its length but more prominent anteriorly The general impression of shape was precisely that of a whale shark  At the time I thought it was probably too small to be a juvenile whale shark and guessed it must have been some other kind of juvenile shark species  I have now had a reasonably good look on the internet image libraries and found three things  1  Whale sharks are born at about 4050 cm 2  They are thought to grow very quickly 3  An image of a juvenile whale shark swimming I found has exactly the posture that I saw This image is on the facebook site of a dive company and differs from what I saw only in that it is not as blue and the white markings were far more obvious on the Keppel bay animal   Another image I found from the Philippines shows much more like the colour pattern I saw   It is also worth noting that that area of Qld has had two seasons of exceptionally high rainfall resulting in two major floods of the Fitzroy River These were in the summers of 201112 and 201213 The most recent flood peak was about 3 months ago in February 2013 Because of the floods the whole Keppel Bay area seems to have an unusually  high abundance of plankton certainly my experience when swimming in clouds of salps and perhaps that has attracted whale sharks  Given the rarity of whale sharks and the size of this meaning it was a probable recent birth I thought I should report it and have sent this same information to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority   Happy to answer any more questions  especially if you can suggest any alternative animals it could have been that I could check  Sorry but I did not get a photograph I dont have GPS coords but could easily work this out one quarter of the distance in a straight line from Rosslyn Bay to Great Keppel Island', 'Keppel Bay  Qld Australia', 'null']\n",
